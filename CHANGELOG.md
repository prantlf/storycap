### Chores

- Fork the project ([3025ff0](https://github.com/prantlf/storycap/commit/3025ff0fb620daa5b9f46682090340fedfd94874))

### BREAKING CHANGES

The new package names are `@prantlf/storycap` and `@prantlf/storycrawler`.

The minimum supported version of Node.js is 20.11.

Names of Storybook packages changed. This version of Storycap will work only with Storybook 9 and newer versions.

## 6.0.0 (2025-10-31)

- The version 5.0.1 from the original package was used as a base for this fork. Publishing 6.0.0 of the new package makes the clear difference. And that manually to enable future automatic publishing. Do not use this version.
